git-heads
=========

A small script that summarizes `git branch --all --verbose` into a table, so you can see if you need to push or fetch/pull from particular remote and branch combination. Useful if you have many active git remotes and branches.

The HEAD commit hashes of all local branches are shown, with those of any corresponding remotes. Checkmarks are used in place of remote HEAD hashes that are the same the local repo HEAD's.

Use it like a regular git command (i.e. `% git heads`) when it's installed in your `$PATH`.

install

    npm i -g git-heads
